This repository contains my various Machine Learning adventures. Thus far I developed from scratch my own implementations of:
- a univariate linear regression model
- a multiple linear regression model 

If you'd like to test them out yourself, you can run the relevant Jupyter Notebook in Binder using the button above. This way you get all the interactivity of Jupyter Notebooks, and can experiment by changing various parameters of the code. Alternatively you can access non interactive renders of the notebooks [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/LucasOpoka/Machine_Learning/tree/main/).
