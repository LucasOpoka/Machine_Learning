This repository contains my various Machine Learning adventures. Thus far I developed my own implementation of a univariate linear regression model using gradient descent. If you'd like to test it out yourself, you can run the relevant Jupyter Notebook in Binder using the button above. This way you get all the interactivity of Jupyter Notebooks, and can experiment by changing various parameters of the code. Alternatively you can access a non interactive render of this notebook [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/LucasOpoka/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Implementing%20Linear%20Regression/implementing_linear_regression.ipynb).
